Download the files locally and open the folder using an IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code).

-> If you want to see the booking application:
Run these 2 commands: "npm install" and "node app.mjs".
Then open the url: "127:0:0:1:3001" 

->If you want to see the data flow execution between the end devices and the local server:
Run the file "mqtt_code.py"
By default, it reads a fake payload that matches the booking so it turns on the light.
You can change it by doing the appropriate changes in the functions "run" and "generate_fake_data"
